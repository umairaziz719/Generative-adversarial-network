# GAN for MNIST

This project demonstrates the use of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate realistic handwritten digits similar to those in the **MNIST dataset**. The GAN consists of two main components:

- **Generator**: Creates fake images of handwritten digits.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real (from MNIST) or fake (generated by the generator).

The model trains by having the generator improve over time based on feedback from the discriminator, eventually producing convincing digit images.
